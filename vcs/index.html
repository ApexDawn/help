    <h1>Bryce Hill's Version Control System --- May 2019</h1>

    <p>What is “version control”, 
        and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
         For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, 
        though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.</p>
    <p>By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature,
         actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
          A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. 
        Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well 
        on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</p>
